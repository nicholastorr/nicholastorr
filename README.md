My name is Nicholas, usually go by Nick. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in Front End and operations. I love contributing to large projects and also developing personal web apps for small companies or startups that can use a good functioning website. The first language I learned was Javascript in a Computer Science class I took in high school and we have been in love every since. I am also partial to Python and PHP as well as a little dabbling in C++ when all I wanted to do was make games.

:apple: Beginner mindset (**open to learning**) and a strong leader
